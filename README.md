# Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

This project implements a **3-tier rule engine** application that evaluates user eligibility based on various attributes like age, department, income, and experience. The system uses **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** to represent conditional rules, allowing dynamic creation, combination, and modification of these rules. It also provides APIs to create, combine, and evaluate rules against user data.

## Features

- **Rule Creation**: Create individual eligibility rules using a simple string format, which are converted to an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for processing.
- **Rule Combination**: Combine multiple rules into a single AST for efficient evaluation.
- **Eligibility Evaluation**: Evaluate user data against created rules and return whether the user meets the eligibility criteria.
- **AST Modification**: Dynamically modify, create, or combine rules, offering flexibility in rule handling.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure that rules and user data are valid and handle errors gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express
  - MongoDB (via Mongoose) for storing rules and metadata
- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js for UI
  - TailwindCSS for styling
- **Other Tools**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - Environment variable management via `.env` files

## Data Structure

- **Node Structure**: The AST is built using a tree-like data structure where:
  - `type`: Indicates the node type, either "operator" (for AND/OR) or "operand" (for conditions like age > 30).
  - `left`: Reference to the left child node.
  - `right`: Reference to the right child node.
  - `value`: Optional value for operand nodes, such as a comparison value (e.g., salary > 50000).

**Sample Rule Representation**:

Example rule:  
`"((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"`

This would be represented as an AST with the top node being an AND operator, and its left and right children as sub-rules.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (local or cloud instance)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thekavikumar/ruleengine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd ruleengine
   ```

3. Install backend and frontend dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Rename the `.env.example` files in the `backend` and `frontend` directories to `.env` and configure your environment variables.

5. (Optional) If using Docker, create and run the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

6. Start the backend server (if not using Docker):

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

7. Start the frontend app (if not using Docker):

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

8. Access the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

### Creating Rules

Use the `/api/rules/create` endpoint to create a new rule. The rule will be converted into an AST and stored in the database.

Example rule:  
`"((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"`

### Combining Rules

Use the `/api/rules/combine` endpoint to combine multiple rules into a single AST. This helps in evaluating complex eligibility criteria by optimizing the rule structure.

### Evaluating Rules

Use the `/api/rules/evaluate` endpoint to evaluate a user's data against the combined AST rule. It returns `true` if the user meets the criteria, otherwise `false`.

Example user data:

```json
{
  "age": 35,
  "department": "Sales",
  "salary": 60000,
  "experience": 3
}
```

## API Design

### Rule Routes

| Route                      | Method | Description                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/rules/create_rule`   | POST   | Parse a rule string and create its AST          |
| `/api/rules/combine_rules` | POST   | Combine multiple rule strings into a single AST |
| `/api/rules/evaluate_rule` | POST   | Evaluate the AST against user data              |

- **POST: `/create_rule`**  
  This route creates a rule by parsing a rule string into an AST and saving it in the database.

  - **Request Body**:
    - `rule_string` (string): The rule to be parsed.
    - `name` (string): The name of the rule.
  - **Success Response**: Returns the created rule in JSON format if the rule is valid and saved.
  - **Error Response**: Returns an error message for invalid rule format or saving issues.

- **POST: `/combine_rules`**  
  This route combines multiple rules into a single AST and saves the combined rule in the database.

  - **Request Body**:
    - `rule_strings` (array): List of rule strings to combine.
    - `name` (string): The name of the combined rule.
  - **Success Response**: Returns the combined rule in JSON format.
  - **Error Response**: Returns an error message if the combination fails.

- **POST: `/evaluate_rule`**  
  This route evaluates a user‚Äôs data against a provided rule string (in AST format).
  - **Request Body**:
    - `rule_string` (string): The AST of the rule to evaluate.
    - `userData` (object): User attributes to be checked against the rule.
  - **Success Response**: Returns `true` or `false` based on whether the user's data satisfies the rule.
  - **Error Response**: Returns an error if evaluation fails.

## Tests

The system includes tests to verify the following functionalities:

1. **Rule Creation**: Ensure that rules are correctly parsed into AST structures.
2. **Rule Combination**: Validate that multiple rules can be merged into a single AST.
3. **Rule Evaluation**: Test various user data inputs against sample rules.
4. **Error Handling**: Check for handling of invalid rule strings or incomplete data.

## Bonus Features

1. **Dockerized Setup**: Enabled containerization with Docker for easier deployment.
2. **Data Validations**: Added validation for rule attributes to match a predefined catalog.
